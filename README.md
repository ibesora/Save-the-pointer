# Save the pointer
Ludum dare 46 [entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/save-the-pointer) competition with the “Keep it alive” theme and my first Ludum Dare!

Save the pointer is a small browser game with trippy visuals and music where you have to keep the pointer alive avoiding to collide with the circles that are drawn on the screen.

With 10 seconds per level, each level increases the difficulty.

How long will you be able to last?
